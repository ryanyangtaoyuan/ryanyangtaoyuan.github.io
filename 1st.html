    <P>
        Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Truth or Consequences, NM, Why, AZ
        <P>

                July 14, 2012 I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: "Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity." I definitely won't be passing any cars.

            </ol>
            got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cellphone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
